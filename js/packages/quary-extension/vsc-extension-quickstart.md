## What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your web extension.
- `package.json` \* this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
- `src/web/extension.ts` \* this is the main file for the browser
- `webpack.config.js` \* the webpack config file for the web main

## Setup

## Get up and running the Web Extension
